Hotel Booking
			

###Description:

This is a hotel booking that runs on the blockchain. It allows owner to list room for sale, it also allows people to book them  with cryptocurrency.Whenever someone buy the room, they instantly become the owner. Thatâ€™s because this application is powered by a smart contract on the blockchain which manages the hotel. It tracks who owns the room for sale, and it transfers the ownership of the items automatically anytime someone buys them with cryptocurrency.
